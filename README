With gulp:

1. Check the different commands in the gulpfile, the preferred command for development is 'gulp', which runs everything we need to test the app, and keeps it running until we close it.
2. Go to localhost:3000 (short URL) to test the running app.
3. REACT: When running gulp, you get both the client and server running for free (short URL), but the react-hot-loader won't trigger and update on its own.
    You can however quickly reload the server application manually by typing 'rs' in the console, and it will restart the server.

With NPM:

1. Use 'npm run dev' for development purposes (uses webpack-dev-server so no need to reload anything), and 'npm run prod' to create files required for production.
2. Go to localhost:3000/dist/client/ (long URL) to test the app without a connection to the server (since it is not running).
3. REACT: When running 'npm run dev', you only get the client (at the long URL), but the react-hot-loader will trigger and update.
